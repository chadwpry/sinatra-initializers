= Sinatra::Initializers

A Sinatra Extension that sets up rails like initializers

== Installation

  $  gem install sinatra-initializers

== Dependencies

This Gem depends upon the following:

=== Runtime:

* sinatra ( >= 1.0 )


=== Development & Tests:

* Not yet setup

== Getting Started

To view the settings in your app, just require and register the extension 
in your sub-classed Sinatra app:
  
  require 'sinatra/initializers'
  
  class YourApp < Sinatra::Base
    
    register Sinatra::Initializers
    
  end


In your "classic" Sinatra app, you just require the extension like this:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'sinatra'
  require 'sinatra/initializers'
  

== Configuration Options

The configuration directory may be defined by setting
the "config_directory" app variable.  Unless it is setup
it will default to "config/initializers"

Add initializer scripts in config/initializers.  Naming
follows a strict pattern of number then name for order priority

  00-first_initializer.rb
  01-second_initializer.rb
